## Description
The Port Scanner module scans a specified target IP address or hostname to detect which network ports are open from port 1 to 1024. Open ports potentially indicate services running on the host that might be exploited. It uses low-level socket programming to attempt connections on ports within the specified range and lists the ports responding affirmatively.
The Brute Forcer module attempts to gain unauthorized access to a web login form by systematically trying passwords from a user-supplied list for a given username. It sends HTTP POST requests to the login URL and analyzes the server’s response to determine if the login was successful. This simulates a brute-force attack, revealing weak passwords and highlighting authentication vulnerabilities.

# Usage Context:
Such a toolkit is used primarily by penetration testers, ethical hackers, and security researchers during security assessments or audits to discover weaknesses before malicious attackers can exploit them. It provides practical automation for identifying accessible services and validating password strength for user accounts on targeted systems. This aids organizations in strengthening their IT security posture by anticipating potential attack vectors.
# Tools and Technologies Used:
Python Programming Language: Chosen for its simplicity, extensive libraries, and community support.
Socket Library: Facilitates network-level port scanning through TCP connection attempts.
Requests Library: Enables efficient handling of HTTP POST requests for brute force testing of web login forms.
VS Code IDE: Utilized for writing, testing, and debugging code, as shown in your screenshots.
Command-Line Interface (CLI): Provides an interactive user interface to select modules and input parameters dynamically.

# CONCLUSION
The modular architecture allows easy expansion by adding new modules for additional penetration testing tasks such as vulnerability scanning, directory brute forcing, or exploitation frameworks. The interactive design streamlines the penetration workflow, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced professionals.This toolkit exemplifies foundational penetration testing capabilities implemented with widely used programming tools in cybersecurity. It not only automates core testing but serves as a platform for further learning and development in the field of ethical hacking.
